# Vercel Deployment Fix

The 404 error is due to complex routing configuration. Here are 2 simple solutions:

## Solution 1: Deploy as Static Site (Recommended)

Since your portfolio is primarily frontend React, deploy it as a static site:

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. **Framework Preset:** `React`  
3. **Build Command:** `npm run build`
4. **Output Directory:** `dist/public`
5. **Install Command:** `npm install`

### Or use the simplified vercel.json:
I've created a simple configuration. Try redeploying with the updated `vercel.json`.

## Solution 2: Use Different Platform

### Try Netlify (Often Easier):
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Build settings are auto-detected from `netlify.toml`
4. Should work immediately

### Or try Render:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create "Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Build Command: `npm run build`
5. Start Command: `npm start`

## Quick Test
Your build is working perfectly locally. The files are:
- `dist/public/index.html` ✅
- `dist/public/assets/` ✅  
- `dist/index.js` ✅

The issue is just Vercel routing configuration.

## Next Steps:
1. Try redeploying with the simplified `vercel.json`
2. If still issues, try Netlify (usually easier for React apps)
3. Render as backup option

Your portfolio build is perfect - just need the right platform configuration!
